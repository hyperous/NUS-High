This is a working copy of the NUS High iPhone app.

In it you will find all the view-controllers, and the main algorithms behind it.

You will also find some Augmented Reality (AR) stuff, as I was working on those for version 1.2. However, plans have changed and I will no longer be working on this app.

Feel free to use the code for your own purposes, but please credit me appropriately.

If you have questions, kindly drop me a message at sidwyn@gmail.com.

Thank you!
